      Welcome ! I am a recent graduate in Astrophysics from the Master in
      Astrophysics of the Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1. I did my Master
      thesis in Marseille in cosmology and my main research interests are
      cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics.


      I am very open minded and I enjoy to discuss about science, environment...
      I like sport especially basketball and skiing and I love to travel
      (backpacker travels) around the world, discover new countries and
      cultures. I was very involved in different student associations which try
      to improve the lifestyle of students.
