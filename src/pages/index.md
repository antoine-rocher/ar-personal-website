      Hello, my name is Antoine Rocher and I am a recent graduate in
      Astrophysique from the Master in Astrophysics of the Universit√© Claude
      Bernard Lyon 1.


      I am very interested in science in general and especially in physics and
      astrophysics. I also like sport (I played basketball during 8 years in
      competition) and I was very involved in university student associations.
