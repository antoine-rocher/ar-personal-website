## **Education**

* **2019 : Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics, speciality Astrophysics,** Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1. 

During my 1st year of Master's degree I studied fundamental physics such as **quantum mechanics, atomic physics, general relativity, electromagnetism theory**... 

I chose to specialize in Astrophysics for my 2nd year of Master's Degree. I studied general astrophysics subjects such as **Galaxies formation and evolution, Stellar and planetary formation, stellar astrophysics, observational cosmology, interstellar meduim**... My Master's thesis was about "**Modelling non-linear effects of redshift-space distortions induced by galaxy peculiar velocities**". I developed a C code for a semi-analytical model of redshift-space distortions.
