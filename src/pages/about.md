## **Education :**

* **2019 : Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics, speciality Astrophysics,** \
  Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. \
  \
  During my 1st year of Master's degree I studied fundamental physics such as **quantum mechanics, atomic physics, general relativity, electromagnetism theory**... \
  I went to Chile for my 2-month internship on **"Hydrodynamic Simulations of protoplanetary discs**" where I perform SPH  numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs around binary stars.\
  I chose to specialize in Astrophysics for my 2nd year of Master's Degree. The courses was at the Centre de Recherche d'Astrophysique de Lyon (CRAL). I studied general astrophysics subjects such as **Galaxies formation and evolution, Stellar and planetary formation, stellar astrophysics, observational cosmology, interstellar meduim**... \
  My Master's thesis was about "**Modelling non-linear effects of redshift-space distortions induced by galaxy peculiar velocities**". I developed a C code for a semi-analytical model of redshift-space distortions. 



* **2017 : Undergraduate degree in Physics (B.Sc.),** Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1
  \
  \
  While I was completing my undergraduate studies, I was very involved in student associations. I first became president of the students association in my university for one year and I was then, for another year, responsible of a social grocery store for students with financial problems.  _See blabla below_

## Projects :

* [Modelling non-linear effects of redshift-space distortions induced by galaxy peculiar velocities**,**](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-2-internship)
  \
  Master 2 intership (4 months) supervised by _Sylvain de la Torre,_ at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM).
  I was working to develop a C code for redshift-space distortions models and compare model predictions with numerical cosmological simulations.
* [Photometric study of the open cluster NGC 1245,](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-2-Observatory-project-OHP)\
  Master 2 project after spending a week at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP)
* [Numerical project on LENSTOOL,](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-2-Numerical-project-LENSTOOL)\
  Master 2 project supervised by Johan Richard. LENSTOOL is a gravitational lensing software for modeling mass distribution of galaxies and clusters (strong and weak regime)
* [Modelisation of the solar system,](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-1-project-Solar-system)\
  Master 1 project, Development of a C++ code to model the solar system.
