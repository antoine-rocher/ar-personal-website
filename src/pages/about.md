I actively **look for a PhD in astrophysics**. My main research interests are in **cosmology** with the study of the **early universe** and **galaxy formation and evolution.** 

In the mean time, to improve my knowledge in physics, I am **currently taking master's courses** in Quantum Field Theory, Particles & Astroparticles physics, Nuclear & Astro-nuclear physics, Atomic & Molecular physics and Statistical physics at _Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1._

## **Education :**

* **2019 : Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics, speciality Astrophysics,** \
   _Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1._ \
   During my first year of Master's degree I studied fundamental physics such as **quantum mechanics, atomic physics, general relativity, electromagnetism theory**... \
   I went to Chile for my two-month internship on **"Hydrodynamic Simulations of protoplanetary discs**" where I performed SPH  numerical simulations of protoplanetary discs around binary stars. I chose to specialize in Astrophysics for my second year of Master. The courses were at the Centre de Recherche d'Astrophysique de Lyon (CRAL). I studied general astrophysics subjects such as **galaxy formation and evolution, stellar and planetary formation, stellar astrophysics, observational cosmology, interstellar medium**... \
   My Master's thesis was about "**Modelling non-linear effects of redshift-space distortions induced by galaxy peculiar velocities**". I developed a C code for a semi-analytical model of redshift-space distortions. 
* **2017 : Undergraduate degree in Physics (B.Sc.),** \
  _Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1._
  \
  While I was completing my undergraduate studies, I was very involved in student associations. I first became president of the association of student in science in my university for a year and then, for another year, I was responsible of a social grocery store for students with financial problems.

## Projects :

* [Modelling non-linear effects of redshift-space distortions induced
  by galaxy peculiar velocities**,**](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-2-internship)
   \
   Master 2 intership (4 months) supervised by _Sylvain de la Torre,_ at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM).
   I was working to develop a C code for redshift-space distortion models and compare model predictions with numerical cosmological simulations.
* [Photometric study of the open cluster NGC 1245,](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-2-Observatory-project-OHP)\
  Master 2 project after spending a week at the Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP)
* [Numerical project on LENSTOOL,](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-2-Numerical-project-LENSTOOL)\
  Master 2 project supervised by Johan Richard. LENSTOOL is a gravitational lensing software to model the mass distribution of galaxies and clusters (strong and weak regime)
* [Modelisation of the solar system,](https://github.com/antoine-rocher/Master-1-project-Solar-system)\
  Master 1 project, Development of a C++ code to model the solar system.
